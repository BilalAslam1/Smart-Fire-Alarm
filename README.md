# Smart-Fire-Alarm
The Smart Fire Alarm project incorporates IOT technology to develop a fire alarm that can detect human life and alert emergency personnel. With this, the device will prioritize areas with possible signs of life and relay this information, where the authorities can better strategize a plan of attack upon arrival.
